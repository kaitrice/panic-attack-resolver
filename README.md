## Description

Innovative mobile application designed to provide immediate support during moments of panic and anxiety. Our app enables users to engage in text-based conversations with a Generative AI, leveraging advanced language models such as Llama.

### Timeline: September 27 - December 15, 2023

## Key Features

- **Instant Support:** Chat with the Generative AI to receive guidance and assistance when experiencing a panic attack.

<!--
- **Adaptability:** Our AI is not static; it can evolve and expand its capabilities over time. This includes training it to handle new situations effectively.
- **Connect with Loved Ones:** The app can be configured to reach out to trusted contacts or loved ones in the event of an emergency, ensuring that help is always within reach.
- **Personalization:** After assisting users in calming and grounding techniques, the chatbot seeks feedback to continually refine its responses and tailor its support for maximum benefit to each individual.

## Usage

1. **Install Expo Go on Your Mobile Device:**
    - Install the Expo Go app from the [App Store (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Google Play Store (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US) on your mobile device.
2. **Start the Development Server:**
    - To run the app with Expo Go, execute the following command on your local machine:

    ```bash
        npx expo start
    ```

3. **Scan the QR Code:**
   1. **Android**
       - Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device.
       - Use the app to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal when you ran `npx expo start`.
   2. **iOS**
       - Open the Camera app on your iPhone.
       - Use your camera to scan the QR code displayed in your terminal when you ran `npx expo start`.

This will load your React Native app on your mobile device.

*Make sure you have an active internet connection because Expo Go loads the app from the Expo server during development.*
